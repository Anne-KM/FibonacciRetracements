# FibonacciRetracements

This is my first project on GitHub.  I am new to programming and want to practice.  It would be great to get comments from more advanced programmers on my code. How could I improve or do things better?  Thank you so much in advance for any help and support.

My project covers some basics on the Fibonacci sequence and its derived retracement levels in finance.  I intend to cover some of the following topics:

* Find out how GitHub works
* Practice basic coding concepts with Python
* Web Scraping of financial data
* Perform Data Visualization and Analysis on this data
