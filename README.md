# FibonacciRetracements

This is my first project on GitHub.  I am new to programming and want to practice.  It would be great to get comments from more advanced programmers on my code. How could I improve or do things better?  Thank you so much in advance for any help and support.

Just when I was doing an exercise on Fibonacci numbers in Python, someone talked to me about Fibonacci Retracements in trading. I am interested in both, learn how to program and the stock market, so I have decided to have a deeper look on this topic and make it my first project.  My intention is to cover some of the following topics:

* Find out how GitHub works
* Practice coding with Python
* Web Scraping of financial data
* Perform Data Visualization and Analysis
